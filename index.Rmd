Arthur Boari was born in Lavras, Minas Gerais, in 1995. His native language is Brazilian Portuguese, but he also speaks, writes, and reads in English. Since he was a child, Arthur has been concerned about the environment, which led him to study environmental engineering years later. In this text, we intend to provide an overview of his journey so far.

Recently, Arthur completed his master's degree in Environmental Engineering. In terms of research, he investigated trends in time series of particulate matter and tropospheric ozone in the capital cities of the southeast region of Brazil. The research resulted in the submission of an article to the journal Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, and the completion of a second article is expected. Arthur was affiliated with the research line on Climate Change, Energy and Atmospheric Pollution of the [Graduate Program in Environmental Engineering](https://sites.google.com/ufla.br/ppgeamb/p%C3%A1gina-inicial?authuser=0) at the Federal University of Lavras (UFLA), where he was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Marcelo Vieira-Filho](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5059318976988668).

During his undergraduate studies in Environmental and Sanitary Engineering at UFLA, Arthur conducted laboratory research on water and sewage samples from treatment plants located on the main campus of UFLA. During this period, he was affiliated with the Environmental Directorate (DMA/UFLA) as a experiential activity (2016), voluntary scientific initiation (2016-2017), and technical learning (2017-2019). The analyses carried out included physical analyses (pH, conductivity, color, and turbidity), chemical analyses (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Biochemical/Chemical Oxygen Demand, Manganese, Total Iron, Total Phosphorus, among others), and biological analyses (Total and Thermotolerant Coliforms), and served as the basis for several publications in local, regional, and national congresses.

Arthur joined the [Núcleo de Estudos de Poluição Urbana e Agroindustrial - NEP UAI](https://sites.google.com/ufla.br/nepuai), where he had the opportunity to start developing projects in the field of atmospheric sciences, such as atmospheric and noise pollution. During the three years he was there, he held various positions where he developed communication, people management, and project management skills. Publications were generated in local and regional congresses, as well as the publication of an international article that investigated the response of lockdown measures to air pollution in stations in the city of São Paulo.

In his undergraduate thesis, Arthur used four methods to estimate evapotranspiration (FAO56-Penman-Monteith, Hargreaves & Samani, Makkink, and Thornthwaite) in the methodology of climatological water balance (Thornthwaite & Mather) for historical series of meteorological data from eight stations in the northeast region of Minas Gerais. [Prof. Dr. Sílvia de Nazaré Monteiro Yanagi](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3943657653311716) supervised the entire project.
